Qestion :In how many ways can the 7 letters M, N, O, P, Q, R, S be arranged so that P and Q occupy
continuous positions?

Solution: For arranging the 7 letters keeping P and Q always together we have to view P and Q as one
letter. Let this be denoted by PQ.
Then, we have to arrange the letters M, N, O, PQ, R and S in a linear arrangement. Here, it is like
arranging 6 letters in 6 places (since 2 letters are counted as one). This can be done in 6! ways.
However, the solution is not complete at this point of time since in the count of 6! the internal arrangement
between P and Q is neglected. This can be done in 2! ways. Hence, the required answer is 6! × 2!.
Task for the student: What would happen if the letters P, Q and R are to be together? (Ans: 5! × 3!)
What if P and Q are never together? (Answer will be given by the formula: Total number of ways –
Number of ways they are always together)
